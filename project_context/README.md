# Project Context Documentation

This directory contains structured documentation about the YoutubeKnowledge Obsidian plugin's architecture and design.

## Files

### static_context.json
- Basic project structure and conventions
- Human-readable documentation
- High-level architecture overview
- Core component descriptions
- Basic data flow documentation

### static_context_ai.json
Enhanced context file optimized for AI analysis with:
- Semantic relationships between components
- Detailed type information
- Data flow specifications
- State management details
- Validation rules
- Security considerations
- Testing requirements
- AI-specific guidelines

## Usage

### For Developers
1. Start with `static_context.json` for a high-level overview
2. Reference component responsibilities and data flows
3. Follow documented conventions for consistency

### For AI Systems
1. Begin with `aiInstructions` in `static_context_ai.json`
2. Follow analysis guidelines for modifications
3. Validate changes against semantic structure
4. Consider documented critical paths
5. Ensure security considerations are met

### Best Practices
- Review both files before making architectural changes
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Follow the conventions documented in both files
- Consider impacts on critical paths
- Maintain test coverage requirements

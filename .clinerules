# Project Context Integration
context_files:
  - "project_context/static_context.json"     # Human-readable context
  - "project_context/static_context_ai.json"  # AI-optimized context
  - "project_context/README.md"               # Usage documentation

# AI Analysis Instructions
ai_guidelines:
  pre_analysis:
    - "Review project_context/static_context_ai.json for semantic structure"
    - "Check component dependencies and relationships"
    - "Understand data flows and validation rules"
    - "Note security and testing requirements"
  
  during_analysis:
    - "Validate changes against documented patterns"
    - "Consider impact on critical paths"
    - "Maintain test coverage requirements"
    - "Follow type naming conventions"
  
  post_analysis:
    - "Update context documentation if needed"
    - "Verify security considerations"
    - "Ensure changes align with project conventions"
    - "Check performance metrics"
    - "Validate test coverage thresholds"

# Performance thresholds
performance:
  bundle_size_limit: "500kb"
  load_time_target: "300ms"
  memory_limit: "50mb"
  
# Testing requirements  
testing:
  coverage_threshold: 80
  required_test_types:
    - "unit"
    - "integration"
    - "e2e"
  test_naming_pattern: "*.test.ts"

# Task Planning Guidelines
task_planning:
  effort_estimation:
    - "Break tasks into components"
    - "Estimate tokens per component"
    - "Account for ripple effects"
    - "Add 20% buffer for unknowns"
  
  ripple_effect_analysis:
    - "Identify dependent services"
    - "List affected test files"
    - "Document required updates"
    - "Track configuration changes"
    - "Note build process impacts"
  
  task_structure:
    - "Divide into phases"
    - "Prioritize core functionality"
    - "Group related changes"
    - "Maintain context between tasks"
    - "Document dependencies"
  
  token_limits:
    - "Max per task: 4000 tokens"
    - "Max context: 8000 tokens"
    - "Optimize for efficiency"
    - "Use pagination when needed"
    - "Monitor usage during execution"
